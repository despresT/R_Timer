# R_Timer
Realise a timer with R to track your work time


1/ You will need to download the 3 file '0_Timer.R', 'timer_table.csv' and 'last_state' and put them under the same directory.

2/ The '0_Timer.R' file is the code for the timer() function. You can source it or just run it. The args of the function could be 'on', 'pause', 'resume' and 'off'. 

3/ The 'last_state' will only record the last arg you were using ('on', 'pause', etc.). All the times will be write in the 'timer_table.csv'file.

4/ I create an option arg to draw simple grpah using ggplot2, but need to be develop.

If you have any problem using this function, just ask me, I will try to help.
